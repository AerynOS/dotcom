The research & initial development stage for Serpent OS.

 - Flesh out basic concepts such as the atomic updates
 - Generate proof of concept tooling to support the delivery of package builds in the proposed moss format.
 - functioning Live ISO boot (`dracut`, `systemd`) via UEFI specifically on KVM (Qemu)
 - working scheduler in the infrastructure for reliable build control.
 - installable system roots (no `upgrade` approach just yet)
 
 Essentially, this is the scaffolding stage to support development of a more complete
 Serpent OS.
