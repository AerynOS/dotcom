Having left the prototype stage, we now move our focus to installable systems
with a limited amount of hardware support, i.e just enough to get a desktop
system up and running for our developers and contributors.

 - Refocus on infrastructure, remove `x86_64` limitation
 - Support automated rebootstraps
 - Support for source repositories
 - System models, capabilities and subscriptions to land in `moss`
 - Initial work on immutable installations and system recovery
