A long overdue, and highly requested update today. We're finally rebranding the project!


## ü§î Why the change?

The "Serpent OS" name was a quickly chosen name that stuck. Unfortunately "serpents" are often associated with
negative connotations, and we've had a lot of feedback over the years that the name was off-putting. Let's be completely
honest, it's not the most inviting name for a project. Who wants to trust a serpent? Generally speaking they're considered
dangerous at best.

It's fair to say we've spent a long time in prototype and alpha phases. In order to move forward, our identity needs
to be more befitting of the project we're building. A move into the real world. This isn't a hobby project, it's a full
blown Linux distribution with serious technical underpinnings, achievements and goals. Getting the tone right from day dot
is critical.

Do note, there is no change to the internal core team, so we're aiming for full continuity and a seamless transition.
Had enough of these snakes on this plane? We have too.

## ‚ú® What's the new name?

Hah, it's not "Evolve OS", despite the clickbait title. Our new name is... drum roll please...

## üåü **AerynOS**

Pronounced like "Erin", it's a name that we feel is more befitting of the project. Pulling from multiple etymologies, it's a name that better describes the project
**now** versus the project that started as Serpent OS.

"Aer" is rather obvious, Latin in origin. The phonetic "Erin" is a nod to the Irish roots of the project, and of course a home.
There are a number of reasons for the name, which will form part of the initial documentation on the new website.

Our intent is to have a name that is more inviting, and more descriptive of the project's goals and aspirations. We're not
anti-establishment or anti-corporation - if anything, we're a statement that without the fiscal handcuffs, we can produce a
technically sound *and* user-friendly operating system.

## ‚è∞ Timeline

Having already secured `AerynOS.com`, `AerynOS.dev`, plus the associated social media accounts, we're now in the process of
rebranding the project. For sheer irony, we'll make the final transition day the 17th of March, 2025. Yes, St. Patrick's Day.
The Matrix space has already been updated, and any areas where a new name isn't feasible will see almost immediate renames.

A new GitHub organisation has been created, with our first priority there to create a proper organisation structure for once.
Over the coming weeks everything will be migrated over, and we'll mark the old organisation read-only/deprecated. Can't have folks
thinking Serpent OS was abandoned, after all.

Stick with us, we've got plenty of exciting news to come over the next days and weeks, as we embrace new transparency and
shed our old skin. Plus, we'll be starting to onboard for web properties, translations, artwork, and more. Cherry on the cake?
Admitting that we're actually building a *full* distribution will allow us to put relevant priorities in place to expose
Serpent OS.. I mean AerynOS .. functionality to the wider world. Get ready for a reboot of the grassroots, independent Linux
scene. We're here to stay.
