## Enable us to enable you 🚀

Let's be straight - building an OS from scratch is no small feat, and our sponsors' support has been instrumental in making this possible. Their backing isn't just about infrastructure costs - it's about enabling us to build something meaningful in the Linux ecosystem.

Your support will go towards covering various project expenses. The project reserves the right to allocate donated funds at its discretion.

## Notable Sponsors 🏆

A special thanks to [Framework](https://frame.work) for providing us with a Framework 13 DIY Edition laptop - it's been invaluable for development, and we're genuinely grateful to Framework for their contribution to the project 💪.
