## Enable us to enable you üöÄ

Let's be straight - building an OS from scratch is no small feat, and our sponsors' support has been instrumental in making this possible. Their backing isn't just about infrastructure costs - it's about enabling us to build something meaningful in the Linux ecosystem.

Your support will go towards covering various project expenses. The project reserves the right to allocate donated funds at its discretion.

You can either contribute via our project-wide Ko-fi account, or via Ikey's GitHub sponsors.
