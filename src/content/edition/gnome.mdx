AerynOS with [GNOME Desktop](https://www.gnome.org/). Solid GTK integration in a clean, functional package that gets out of your way. We built this to actually work - no bloat, no buzzwords, just a damn good desktop that lets you get things done.

We use this Gnome Edition as our live installer for all Desktop Environments through our 'lichen' installer.
