AerynOS with [GNOME Desktop](https://www.gnome.org/). Solid GTK integration in a clean, functional package that gets out of your way. We built this to actually work - no bloat, no buzzwords, just a damn good desktop that lets you get things done.

We use this Gnome Edition to serve as a vehicle for our ‘lichen’ live installer which is able to install all of our ‘GNOME’, ‘KDE Plasma’, ‘Cosmic’ and a ‘Terminal Only’ versions of AerynOS. It will always pull the latest packages from our repository at the time of installation.
