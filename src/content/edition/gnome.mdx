AerynOS with [GNOME Desktop](https://www.gnome.org/). Solid GTK integration in a clean, functional package that gets out of your way. We built this to actually work - no bloat, no buzzwords, just a damn good desktop that lets you get things done.

We use this Gnome Edition to serve as a vehicle for our â€˜lichenâ€™ live installer which is able to install all of our â€˜GNOMEâ€™, â€˜KDE Plasmaâ€™, â€˜Cosmicâ€™ and a â€˜Terminal Onlyâ€™ versions of AerynOS. It will always pull the latest packages from our repository at the time of installation.
