  <Cover title="About"> About AerynOS </Cover>

  <Lead>
    AerynOS is a modern Linux distribution using atomic updates, cutting-edge
    tooling and rock-solid reliability. Built by industry veterans with decades
    of experience, it represents the next evolution in Linux distributions -
    delivering a safe and efficient system üêç

    <p>
      Our fully atomic system leverages the <ExtLink href="https://llvm.org/"
        >LLVM</ExtLink
      > toolchain and libc++ by default, delivering superior diagnostics and package
      diversity. We're not afraid to challenge convention - thoughtfully replacing
      traditional components with modern alternatives that prioritize safety and
      reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      We closely follow the work of organizations dedicated to making software
      safer, including the <ExtLink href="https://www.memorysafety.org/"
        >Prossimo project</ExtLink
      > and their Memory Safety initiative, the <ExtLink
        href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en">Tweede Golf</ExtLink
      > team, and the <ExtLink href="https://trifectatech.org/"
        >Trifecta Tech Foundation</ExtLink
      >. By monitoring and adopting innovations from these pioneers, we can
      integrate proven solutions like memory-safe replacements for critical
      system components.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we continuously evaluate and adopt the best solutions, our
      architectural decisions enable powerful features like atomic updates that
      can safely transform your entire system, complete with built-in
      deduplication and instant rollbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the future of Linux distribution design, built on a foundation of
      experience and innovation.

      Want a rolling release distribution that just works? We're building
      AerynOS to be the system that gets out of your way and lets you focus on
      what matters. Our atomic updates mean you can keep rolling forward without
      the usual headaches - no manual interventions, no update anxiety. When we
      say rolling release, we mean it should be as simple as running an update
      and getting back to work. Join us on this journey as we continuously
      improve and refine the experience.
