Serpent OS is a modern Linux distribution using atomic updates, cutting-edge tooling and rock-solid reliability. Built by industry veterans with decades of experience, it represents the next evolution in Linux distributions - delivering a safe and efficient system üêç

Our fully atomic system leverages the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) toolchain and libc++ by default, delivering superior diagnostics and package diversity. We're not afraid to challenge convention - thoughtfully replacing traditional components with modern alternatives that prioritize safety and reliability.

We closely follow the work of organizations dedicated to making software safer, including the [Prossimo project](https://www.memorysafety.org/) and their Memory Safety initiative, the [Tweede Golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en) team, and the [Trifecta Tech Foundation](https://trifectatech.org/). By monitoring and adopting innovations from these pioneers, we can integrate proven solutions like memory-safe replacements for critical system components.

As we continuously evaluate and adopt the best solutions, our architectural decisions enable powerful features like atomic updates that can safely transform your entire system, complete with built-in deduplication and instant rollbacks.

This is the future of Linux distribution design, built on a foundation of experience and innovation.

## Daily driver

Want a rolling release distribution that just works? We're building Serpent OS to be the system that gets out of your way and lets you focus on what matters. Our atomic updates mean you can keep rolling forward without the usual headaches - no manual interventions, no update anxiety. When we say rolling release, we mean it should be as simple as running an update and getting back to work. Join us on this journey as we continuously improve and refine the experience.
