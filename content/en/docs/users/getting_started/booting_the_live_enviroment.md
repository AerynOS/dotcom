## Booting from a USB Drive

{{< alert color="primary" >}}
Ensure that your system is set to boot from the USB drive. You may need to access the boot menu to select the USB drive as the boot device.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="secondary" >}}
Currently NVIDIA Drivers are not implemented by the live environment and will fallback to nouveau drivers.
{{< /alert >}}

1. Insert the bootable USB drive into your system and boot from the USB drive.
2. You should see the Serpent OS boot process, and you will be presented with the live environment.

## Testing the Live Environment

{{< alert color="info" >}}
The live environment may run slower than the installed system due to the limitations of running from a USB drive.
{{< /alert >}}

Once you have booted into the live environment, you can test Serpent OS without installing it on your system.

- Explore the desktop environment.
- Test the pre-installed applications.
- Check the system performance.
- Verify the hardware compatibility.
- Connect to the internet and browse the web.
