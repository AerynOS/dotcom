Let's be straight - building an OS from scratch is no small feat, and our sponsors' support has been instrumental in making this possible. Their backing isn't just about infrastructure costs - it's about enabling us to build something meaningful in the Linux ecosystem.

Your support helps cover our hosting costs and allows us to dedicate more time to making Serpent OS exceptional. You can either contribue via our project-wide Ko-fi account, or via Ikey's GitHub sponsors. We're still in the process of establishing a structure that
would give us access to organisation-wide Github Sponsors.

## Notable Sponsors üèÜ

A special thanks to [Framework](https://frame.work) for providing us with a Framework 13 DIY Edition laptop - it's been invaluable for development üî•.
