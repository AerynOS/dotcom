## Project viability

AerynOS has been designed with scalability and efficiency of resources in mind. During the second half of 2025, the team conducted an audit and made changes that both reduced running costs but also improved capability. Key to this was the teams approach to utilize as much internal resources as possible (such as ermo's personal build servers) and then only paying 3rd parties for the needed servers / solutions we can't effectively deliver in-house.

Donations coming in through Ko-fi adequately offset all project costs meaning the project is self sustaining.

## How will funding help the project

The primary way to help the project at this state is through further donations. Your support will help us continue to improve and expand the project, as we work towards stable releases.

At a high level, the team would like to build up an amount of savings to cover project running costs in case of emergency. Outside of this, we would also like to invest in additional build servers to support multi-arch and psABI builds.

Finally, as we scale out into a more serious project, we would eventually like to be in a position where we can utilize funds for defined projects such as branding, website design or anything else that may come up.

## How to help with funding

Our primary method of funding is through Ko-fi:
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support me on Ko-fi', '#794bc4', 'J3J511WM9N');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>

    *   Puts AerynOS is on a strong foundation for viability
2. How would additional funding help the project
    *   Work towards additional build servers (multi-arch, psABI)
    *   Build up nest egg for disaster planning
    *   Allow for defined project focused spending (i.e. branding or website design)
3. The way to help fund the project
    *   Ko-fi
