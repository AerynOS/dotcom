## What type of community do we want to foster?

AerynOS is a community-driven project that values collaboration, inclusivity, and diversity. We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, and we strive to create a welcoming and supportive environment where people can learn, share, and grow together.

As a team, a vein of questions we repeatedly see are:

> Why should I care or be excited about AerynOS?<br>

## A rising tide lifts all boats

Particularly whilst we are in "alpha", we aren't interested in comparisons with any other distributions or approaches that could be taken. We are building the tooling and (eventually) the Linux distribution we want to run on our hardware. Other Linux distributions have their place and users for whom those distributions are perfectly valid options. We aren't looking to be "the best distro" or have some level of negative competitive tension.

  AerynOS is one option in the wider Linux ecosystem. We think it's good but we don't need to be hostile with any other Linux distributions or their userbases!
