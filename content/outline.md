1. Goals / deliverables
    *   Build distro-tooling that intrinsically supports robust packaging via maintainer friendly workflows that respects people's time and needs, and knows how to take care of itself.
    *   Foundational focus on reliability, proven performance, and efficiency in all areas
    *   Flexibility by design (imperative vs declarative, rolling release via streams vs. pinning to point-in-time repo tags)
2. Key sponsorships
    *   Framework
    *   Zulip
    *   Migadu
3. Documentation and Codebase
    *   Link to documentation site
    *   Link to codebase (GitHub/Forge)


## About

1. Summany and mission statement
    *   Build distro-tooling that intrinsically supports robust packaging via maintainer friendly workflows that respects people's time and needs, and knows how to take care of itself.
    *   Foundational focus on reliability, proven performance and efficiency (this has *always* been the case; it is why we have so many tuning options in boulder for instance, and it is why we are so much faster than OSTree whilst still being atomic)
    *   Flexibility by design (imperative vs declarative, rolling release via streams vs. pinning to point-in-time repo tags, of FS)
2. Maybe a timeline with key milestones (maybe by year or by month in year if there is alot)?
    *   Start 5 years ago with creation of Serpent OS up to present
        *   Ikey retiring from the project and new "leadership"
        *   First boot of desktop environment? August 2024
        *   First pre-alpha release and then to first alpha release
        *   Completion of Rust re-write of os-tools and infrastucture
3. Desktop choice (what is our flagship? We have three co-equal DEs, because having a flagship is counterproductive. KDE Plasma is currently default in lichen but we use GNOME live ISO)
    *   What environments we offer with a picture and key default packages
        Turn key ready desktop environments:
        *   KDE Plasma
        *   GNOME
        *   CosmicDE
        Do it yourself experiences:
        *   Terminal-only
        *   Niri
        *   Sway
        *   TBC: MangoWC
